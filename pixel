pixel

Why are pixels dead ?
	They are static(But technically so are most of the others)
	they do not respect the root-font size after changes (They are not truly relative to the root font-size like REM and EM units)
	Properties such as margins, padding and line-height do not scale naturally when re-set in-line.
	Apparently, Bootstrap 4 is dropping pixels for REM.
	Pixels create the illusion of being equal to on-screen pixels which leads to misconceptions and in the long run becomes confusing to new developers.
	Pixels are unlikely to become a viable solution for scaling fonts in the future since design is comprehensively about proportions.
